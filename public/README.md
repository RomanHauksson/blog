This is my personal homepage and blog, built using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the Hugo theme [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) that I heavily modified.

## modifications

- Buttons are in the style of claymorphism and rotate when you hover over them
- The width of the header is the same as that of the content
- I completely revamped the "profile-info mode" page by adding a long description and moving the buttons around
- Every title is lowercase
- Any post's table of contents takes up the full width of the page
- Post tags are next to the post title
- Next and previous post buttons at the bottom of each post look like the rest of the buttons
- The copyright disclaimer is different
- Other miscallaneous changes I have forgotten
